Contestants are requested to submit the following:
1. A .csv file with ETH price predictions over a 12-hour period, with the first prediction presenting the price on Monday February 20, 2023 at 1:00am UTC and a prediction for every hour on the hour after that, for 12 predictions total.
2. A report of 10-15 slides describing your approach, difficulties encountered and challenges faced while using the Ocean library and/or recommendations you may have. Think of this as a “conference presentation” for your work.
3. Use the proper flow to submit your prediction. This includes storing the predictions onto Arweave, publishing the predictions on Ocean Market and sharing the datatoken to the judges for accessing such predictions.
