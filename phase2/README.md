## Challenge
Submission deadline is Dec 11, 2022 at 23:59 UTC.
Contestants are requested to submit the following:
1. A .csv file with ETH price predictions over a 12-hour period, with first prediction on Monday December 12, 2022 at 1:00am UTC and a prediction every hour on the hour after that, for 12 predictions total. This must be submitted as its own dataset in Ocean via the instructions provided in the README below.
2. A report of 10-15 slides describing your approach, difficulties encountered and insights you gained in making the predictions. Think of this as a “conference presentation” for your work.
3. At least one slide presenting any challenges faced while using the Ocean library and/or recommendations you may have.
